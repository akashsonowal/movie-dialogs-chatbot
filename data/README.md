# Cornell Movie Dialogs Dataset

The [Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) is a rich dataset of movie character dialog:

220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters

9,035 characters from 617 movies

304,713 total utterances

This dataset is large and diverse, and there is a great variation of language formality, time periods, sentiment, etc. Our hope is that this diversity makes our model robust to many forms of inputs and queries.
